<p>This package includes the query parser, the query AST classes, and various
<em>decorations</em> on the query AST. Some examples of decoration are</p>
<ul>
<li>The stemmed form of a token literal obtained by a suitable
term processor.</li>
<li>Matchers for tokens or phrases.</li>
<li>The corpus and document frequencies of a literal token, phrase
or entity that appears in the query.</li>
<li>Entity or type IDs obtained from a catalog.</li>
</ul>
<p>For now, we will implement decorations as mutable members to be written by
suitable decorators, despite the usual risks of globally visible mutable
members.</p>

<p>Apart from decoration prior to query execution, some AST nodes have
mutable members that are assigned during query execution. Accessing these
members is not thread-safe. If the same query AST has to be used with
multiple documents or indexes in the same process, a deep copy should be 
made first.</p>
